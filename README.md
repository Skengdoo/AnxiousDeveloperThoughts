# AnxiousDeveloperThoughts
Here is just a range of my feelings within 8 years of programming ive done its changed the person i am due to the cruel nature of some of the communities you come across and especially the long hours spending daily on pc.


1.) i dont know if any other programmer does this but im constantly always putting my source code that im working on at the time im always putting it onto external drives making 5000 copies just to never go back to the files and go back off from them and just have the usbs laying around but this is just a strange thing i do lol.




2.) scared to admit my true intelligence to irl friends or show any form of computer knowledge affraid to be judged and looked at differently so i just act the way everyone around my college does and maybe this has ruined my focus massivley.



3.) Never being able to understand being taught something by someone telling me one thing at a time i must ask questions im a Why, How , When type of person i like to understand everything before i can feel confident enough to even engage with the topic/subject and the teachers have to have a certain way of teaching, yes it can be frustrating but you got to understand if you dont explain something well enough to someone the picture in your head could be mapping out a completly different one in your mind.


4.) bad anxiety / depression moments when thinking of coding and progressing further into computers and not having the energy to power on your pc
